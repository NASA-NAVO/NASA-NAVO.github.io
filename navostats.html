        <h1>NAVO Service Monitor Statistics - Demo Page</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            NAVO has started regularly querying some TAP and Cone Search services to collect 
            data on their response times.  So far this is mostly NAVO services, but also includes 
            a CDS 2MASS cone search for comparison.  (Some Chandra Source Catalog queries are 
            also done, but due to sparse sky coverage these need to be adjusted.)
        </p>
        <p>The queries are done using the <code>servicemon</code> application 
            (<a href="https://servicemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener" 
            target="_blank">https://servicemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>), 
            and are executed from several different locations.  The AWS instrumentation is 
            handled with the software at <a href="https://github.com/NASA-NAVO/AWS_servicemon" 
            rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/NASA-NAVO/AWS_servicemon</a>.  
            The results are written to a TAP-accessible database currently running at IPAC.  
        </p>
        <h2>Exploring the Results</h2>
        <h3>Via Static Web Pages</h3>
        <p>
            Plots are generated each week to summarize the statistics for the week.  Those are available here:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id='myapp'>
        <div>
            <button v-on:click="openWeeklyPage" style="font-size:larger;">Open statistics for week of</button>
            <v-date-picker 
                v-model="date_selected" 
                :model-config="modelConfig"
                :available-dates="availableDates"
                :locale="locale"
                >
                <template v-slot="{ inputValue, inputEvents }">
                    <input
                        class="bg-white border px-2 py-1 rounded"
                        :value="inputValue"
                        v-on="inputEvents"
                        readonly
                        style="font-size:larger;"
                    />
                </template>
            </v-date-picker>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Using the TAP Service</h3>
        <p>The results are available via a TAP service at 
            <a href="http://navo01.ipac.caltech.edu/TAP" rel="noopener" 
            target="_blank">http://navo01.ipac.caltech.edu/TAP</a> which has a table 
            called <code>navostats2</code> with one row per query run by servicemon. 
            This table contains data starting from about April 6, 2021.  
        </p>

            the TAP service, please see the <a href="https://nasa-navo.github.io/notebooks/ExplorePerformanceData.html" rel="noopener"
